# week2-challenge

## Description
This is my first pass at making an online portfolio. There are navigation links to quickly access the four main sections of the webpage. Additionally there is a 'Back to Top' button at the bottom of the pages so users won't have to scroll as much.

The About Me section contains a short description of myself and two photos. The Education section briefly outlines my post-secondary education. The Works section links to projects that I have completed. Web projects will open in a new tab, while downloadable files will be downloaded when clicked. The contact section has a link to send me an email as well as a form that accomplishes the same thing as the link.
