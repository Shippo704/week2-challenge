# week2-challenge

## Description
This is my first pass at making an online portfolio. There are navigation links to quickly access the four main sections of the webpage. Additionally there is a 'Back to Top' button at the bottom of the pages so users won't have to scroll as much.

The About Me section contains a short description of myself and two photos. 

The Education section briefly outlines my post-secondary education. 

The Works section links to projects that I have completed. Web projects will open in a new tab, while downloadable files will be downloaded when clicked. The images have hover effects to indicate what is being examined.

The Contact section has a link to send me an email as well as a form that accomplishes the same thing as the link. There are hover and focus effects on the input boxes of the form and placeholder text when they are empty.

The focus effects show up as a black border around any link or input area on the webpage that is focused on.

I used and adapted some code from [https://blog.getform.io/how-to-create-an-html-form-that-sends-you-an-email/](https://blog.getform.io/how-to-create-an-html-form-that-sends-you-an-email/) and [https://codepen.io/hubspot/pen/abYWrOz](https://codepen.io/hubspot/pen/abYWrOz) to help me make a form that can send an email.
