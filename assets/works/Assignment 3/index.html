<p>People enjoy summer for various reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; color:#245C7F">
<li>Warm Weather</li>
<li>Physical Activity</li>
<li>Camping</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>Sports</li>
<li>Socialising</li>
<li>Sun</li>
<li>Ice Cream</li>
<li>FREE TIME!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I can get behind some of these things, I am sensitive to both heat and light. Socialising with almost anyone for more than 20 minutes will exhaust me. Summer is my least favourite season.</p>

<p>I disagree. I like winter better, but this assignment is supposed to be about summer, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Reasons I prefer winter:</p>
<ul  style="list-style-type: disc; color:#245C7F">
<li>Cold Weather</li>
<li>Snow</li>
<li>Skiing</li>
<li>Hot Chocolate and Tea</li>
<li>Warm Houses and Blankets</li>
<li>Less Socialising</li>
<li>NO BUGS!</li>

<td style="text-align:justify;" colspan="5">That said, summer "vacation" can still be a time to enjoy some activities and hobbies. This website will outline the things that I will be doing this summer. I like to spend my free time biking and practising music. However, free time is hard to come by between work. As such, I haven't had a proper summer "vacation" since 2011 when I graduated from high school and worked a lot less. Previous summers I have worked two jobs, as a pharmacy assistant and as a CAO analyst at a grocery store. This summer, the work will be significantly different.</td>
