<p>Free time is for children, teens, and people who have careers and saved up vacation days. I have 2 degrees in music and biochemistry with a minor in mathematics, pharmacy experience, experience in inventory management, and a small portfolio of excel-coded spreadsheets used during the pandemic to organize patient callback lists. I also have several references who are held in high esteem within their respective companies. I still can't get a job because university doesn't give you anything useful without completing a co-op or internship. Undergrad degrees don't matter, grades don't matter, effort barely matters. You could apply to over 50 places and get no calls back.</p>
<p> This is not to say that there is not purpose to attending a university. It is a lot of fun to learn about the things that interest you and many students enjoy the transition period between living with their parents and living with others their own age. There are many values to higher education institutions, but starting a career after graduation is not one for most majors.</p>
<p>In my attempt to get hired anywhere for anything (that isn't minimum wage) I will be spending the next 6 months in a coding boot camp aimed at web design and data analytics. Boot camps are associated with accredited universities and cost about as much as one year in an undergrad program for the entire duration.</p>

<p>What you learn in these boot camps is bullet point for bullet point what employers are looking for. Listings on indeed.ca for a given profession ask for experience with and/or portfolios demonstrating an ability to do specific things. All of these (save for bilingualism in certain professions) are coverd during the boot camp term.</p>
<p>After the program is complete, several boot camps will offer career counselling services including sharing resumes with various companies, aid in building a LinkedIn profile, and aid in improving a resume. These services are available for 60 days after completion. Instructors and TAs can become references upon completion of the program.</p>
<p>For many boot camp programs, there is essentially no entry requirement. For the web coding and analytics programs, it is a 20 question open book multiple choice. 40 minutes were given, and 5 minutes were taken to get a perfect score. Anyone with access to google and a solid grasp of grade 8 math should have no problems getting a perfect score.</p>
