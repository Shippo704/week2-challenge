            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am 29 years old and have dabbled in coding for the past few years. I have some 
                experience with HTML, CSS, JS, Java, Python, and Excel Visual Basic. While 
                at Western University, I took classes in web design and data analytics. As part of 
                the web design course, I was tasked with creating two simple websites from scratch, 
                including styling and image editing when appropriate. Links to the websites can be 
                found in the Sites tab.

        <section id="Education" class="infocard">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I have studied at three Ontario universities and obtained two degrees.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Queen's University - B.H. Music 2011-2015</li>
                <li>Queen's University - Concurrent B. Education 2011-2015</li>
                <li>Carleton University - B. Biochemistry 2016-2020</li>
                <li>Western University - Computer Science 2022-2023</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B.H. Music and B. Ed.</h3>
            <p>I studied my Bachelor Honours in Music concurrently with a Bachelor of Education. I was 
                accepted to the School of Music as a pianist, though my academic studies focused primarily 
                on music theory and education. I graduated with an undeclared minor in Mathematics and 
                an A- GPA.
            </p>

            <h3>B. Biochemistry</h3>
            <p>I studied biochemistry at Carleton University with the hopes of one day becoming a pharmacist. 
                After spending four years working as a pharmacy assistant, I learned that the field wasn't for 
                me and decided to try to learn to code. During my time at Carleton, I was especially interested 
                in the field of bioinformatics, which combines the fields of biochemistry and computer science.
            </p>

            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
            <p>My goal was to study Bioinformatics at Western University. Instead, I was accepted into the general 
                program. Since I couldn't transfer to bioinformatics, I decided to learn what I could in one year 
                before registering for a coding bootcamp to further propel my studies.

                <p>I was given a notepad document of the information to be displayed across five webpages. From there, 
                    I was tasked with designing a website to display the information and meet certain criteria to display
                    my knowledge of HTML and styling. All components had to be within a table and display properly on all 
                    browsers on the university computers. The original live site has been taken down as of Apr. 30, 2023.

                <p>I was tasked with creating a 5-page website about what I will be doing during summer 2023. The 
                    website had to have external links, an e-mail link, several relevant images, a self-designed banner,
                    and relevant information pertaining to the theme of summer. I experimented with inline styling 
                    to create a restricted background gradient that matched the gradient on the banner. I was required to 
                    create an animation using Microsoft Powerpoint and to edit a 25-30s video with hard and soft subtitles.
                    All components had to be within a table and display properly on all browsers on the university computers. 
                    The original live site has been taken down as of Apr. 30, 2023.

                <h4><a href="assets/works/Blank Bingo Card Generator.xlsm" download>Excel Blank Bingo Card Generator</a></h4>
                <p>I originally designed this bingo card generator for a friend who does bingo card randomiser runs of 
                    the game Hollow Knight. Together, we had brainstormed over 200 prompts to play with various game mods. 
                    I have since repurposed the code and remade the game-specific generator into a blank copy for anyone 
                    to fill up with their own prompts and generate cards with. The Excel workbook contains instructions for 
                    use and has a bery basic anti-duplication algorithm built in.
