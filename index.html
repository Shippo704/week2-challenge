    <section id="About">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am 29 years old and have dabbled in coding for the past few years. I have some 
            experience with HTML, CSS, JS, Java, Python, and Excel Visual Basic. While 
            at Western University, I took classes in web design and data analytics. As part of 
            the web design course, I was tasked with creating two simple websites from scratch, 
            including styling and image editing when appropriate. Links to the websites can be 
            found in the Sites tab.

    <section id="Education">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I have studied at three Ontario universities and obtained two degrees.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Queen's University - B.H. Music 2011-2015</li>
            <li>Queen's University - Concurrent B. Education 2011-2015</li>
            <li>Carleton University - B. Biochemistry 2016-2020</li>
            <li>Western University - Computer Science 2022-2023</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B.H. Music and B. Ed.</h3>
        <p>I studied my Bachelor Honours in Music concurrently with a Bachelor of Education. I was 
            accepted to the School of Music as a pianist, though my academic studies focused primarily 
            on music theory and education. I graduated with an undeclared minor in Mathematics and 
            an A- GPA.
        </p>

        <h3>B. Biochemistry</h3>
        <p>I studied biochemistry at Carleton University with the hopes of one day becoming a pharmacist. 
            After spending four years working as a pharmacy assistant, I learned that the field wasn't for 
            me and decided to try to learn to code. During my time at Carleton, I was especially interested 
            in the field of bioinformatics, which combines the fields of biochemistry and computer science.
        </p>

        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>My goal was to study Bioinformatics at Western University. Instead, I was accepted into the general 
            program. Since I couldn't transfer to bioinformatics, I decided to learn what I could in one year 
            before registering for a coding bootcamp to further propel my studies.

            <p>I was given a notepad document of the information to be displayed across five webpages. From there, 
                I was tasked with designing a website to display the information and meet certain criteria to display
                my knowledge of HTML and styling. All components had to be within a table and display properly on all 
                browsers on the university computers.

            <p>I was tasked with creating a 5-page website about what I will be doing during summer 2023. The 
                website had to have external links, an e-mail link, several relevant images, a self-designed banner,
                and relevant information pertaining to the theme of summer. I experimented with inline styling 
                to create a restricted background gradient that matched the gradient on the banner. I was required to 
                create an animation using Microsoft Powerpoint and to edit a 25-30s video with hard and soft subtitles.
                All components had to be within a table and display properly on all browsers on the university computers.
